# Planeswalkers-Guide

As a big fan of the card game – Magic the Gathering, I wanted to create an application that would help people familiarise themselves with some of the main personalities around which the plot of the “Multiverse” is based.
The Planeswalkes’s Guide is a web catalogue created to provide information about some of the main characters of the world of Magic the Gathering. At the moment there are around 20 planeswalkers in the system, with the option for expansion. More information can be added to the JSON file containing the planeswalkers’ data. The app is written in Python utilising the Flask framework with the help of Jinja2 templating, HTML, JavaScript and Bootstrap framework.
